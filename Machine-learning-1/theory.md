# Feature Extraction and Selection

Freature extraction is a process of transforming raw data into a simplified and more informative respresentation (self of feature or attributes).

- improve performance of machinen learning algorithms
- prevent overfitting 
- better insights
- reduce computational cost

Techniques of feature extraction:
- Statical Methods: mean, median, variance, standerd deviation, correction coefficients, covariance, regression analysis
- Dimentionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, LDA
- Feature extraction for Textual Data: Bag of Words(BoW), TF-IDF, Word Embeddings(Word2Vec, GloVe)
-Image Processing Technique: Edge Detection, color histrogram, Texture analysis, CNN

Few techniques for feature selection:
- Information Loss
- Complexity Reduction
